Presently, the script "run-cocoapods.sh" calls "pod install --no-integrate"
which causes the projects in "Podfile" to be downloaded and placed in the
"Cocoapods/Pods/" directory. The needed source files were then dragged into
the project manually.

This is less than perfect, but the workspace file and other project 
integration which happens without the "--no-integrate" flag is still too
messy. As Cocoapods approaches version 1.0 we can re-assess.

Note: the "Cocoapods/Pods/" directory is wiped every time "run-cocoapods.sh"
runs. So don't manually place any files in this directory.

The "Podfile" may still be edited to include new Cocoapod dependencies,
and they will be automatically downloaded on each time "run-cocoapods.sh"
runs, but for the project to actually used them their source files will 
have to be manually dragged into the project (once) so Xcode can reference
them. Be sure to drag them into the existing "Cocoapods/Pods" group in Xcode.

Also note: the "run-cocoapods.sh" script only runs during a build if it
is un-commented out: "Targets > Wikipedia > Build Phases" then expand the 
first "Run Script" entry and change "#scripts/run-cocoapods.sh" to
"scripts/run-cocoapods.sh".

For now comment "run-cocoapods.sh" back out after running it
to do an update. Update is only needed if new versions are available.
In this case update "Podfile" to specify what new version to retrieve
before uncommenting the "run-cocoapods.sh" build script.
