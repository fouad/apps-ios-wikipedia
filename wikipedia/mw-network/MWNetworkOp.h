"aboutToStart" provides a nice bookend to the built-in NSOperation "completionBlock".
It allows dependent operations to incorporate some data produced by the operations on
which they depend (whose operation will be complete by the time aboutToStart is
invoked because of the dependency) *before* they start. Nice as it allows chained ops
to basically relay info to ops further down the dependency chain without requiring a
delegate or controller to marshal inter-op communications (although nothing about
"aboutToStart" prevents such an arrangement from being used).
